This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Execute chunks by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

#In this Notebook, we will learn how to import data into R and manipulate it.

```{r}
#clear R's brain, always a good first step in any notebook you write
rm(list=ls())
```

#load the necessary libraries
```{r}
#a package for reading in data
library(readr)
#a package for reading data manipulation
library(dplyr)
#a package for plotting your data
library(ggplot2)
#specify this to enable plotting to work
options(bitmapType='cairo')
```

#import the example compensation data
```{r}
Comp<- read_csv("compensation.csv")
```

#to illustrate the most common error.
```{r}
Comp2<- read_csv("CCompensation.csv")
```

#perform some basic checks on the data to check it has read in correctly

```{r}
#simply type the name of your dataset (may not work so well for huge datasets)
Comp
```

```{r}
#check what data structure you have
is.data.frame(Comp)
```

```{r}
#view your data in a nice table format that opens in a new tab
View(Comp)
```

```{r}
#check the names assigned to each column
names(Comp)
```

```{r}
#return the first 6 rows of the dataset
head(Comp)
```

```{r}
#return the number of rows and columns (the dimensions) of the dataset
dim(Comp)
```

```{r}
#return information on the structure of the dataset, including:
#its dimensions, variable names and variable types, listing the first few values for each
str(Comp)
```

```{r}
#another useful command to check your dataset using the dplyr package
#provides a horizontal view of your data
glimpse(Comp)
```

#now we will perform basic data analysis and manipulation using dplyr
```{r}
#get summary statistics
summary(Comp)
```

#Data subsetting

Select - to select columns from your dataset

```{r}
#select just the fruit column by name
select(Comp,Fruit)
```

```{r}
#select all columns apart from this one
select(Comp, -Fruit)
```

Slice - to select rows from your dataset

```{r}
#get only the second row
slice(Comp, 2)
```

```{r}
#get all rows apart from the second row
slice(Comp, -2)
```

```{r}
#get a continuous range of rows
slice(Comp, 2:10)
```

```{r}
#get a discontinuous range of rows
slice(Comp, c(2, 3, 5))
```

Filter - get a subset of rows that match certain column conditions

```{r}
#select rows using a conditional on the value in a columns
my_data.big<-filter(Comp, Fruit > 80)
my_data.big
```

```{r}
#select rows using a combination of conditionals for the values in a column
filter(Comp, Fruit > 80 | Fruit < 20)
```

#Data sorting

Arrange - sort the rows in your data frame
```{r}
#arrange in increasing numerical order
arrange(Comp, Fruit)
```

#how to learn more about a function
```{r}
?filter
```

#Data Transforming

Mutate - to create new variables (columns) in your data frame

```{r}
Comp<-mutate(Comp, logFruit = log(Fruit))
View(Comp)
```

#combine different dpylr verbs for data manipulation
```{r}
select(filter(Comp, Fruit > 80), Root)

```

#summarising: going further with dplyr
```{r}
my_summary<-summarise(group_by(Comp, Grazing), meanFruit = mean(Fruit))
my_summary
```

#how many data points do we have in each categorical group?

```{r}
#table(select(Comp,Grazing))

#or we can do it by referring to the column by name using dollar sign
table(Comp$Grazing)
```
