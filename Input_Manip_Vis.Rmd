This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

#In this Notebook, you will gain experience with importing data into R, manipulating and visualising it. 
#This notebook is formative only and will therefore not contribute to your final module mark.

Your Task
Work through the code chunks in the following notebook to develop your understanding of how to import data into R, manipulate and plot it. 

Follow the instructions for each code chunk, adding code where specified and using the exact variable names supplied. 
You can add your own additional code chunks as needed to gain further practice as you work through the notebook.

## Investigation of animal Weight
We are interested to work out how the weight of the animals varies by various
factors, including species, sex and type of plot.

Start by investigating the `weight` column of the data frame.  
Use the `summary` function to give a numerical summary of the values in the `weight` column (not the whole data frame).

```{r}
#Use "summary" to show a summary of the "weight" column of the data frame and assign the result to a variable called `weight.summ`.
#Hint: use select() to select a column by name.
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/IMV_weight.summ.R")
```

The summary statistics have given us some idea of the distribution, but a histogram would be even better.
Next, plot a histogram of the `weight` column data.

```{r}
#Plot a histogram of the values in the "weight" column.
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

The histogram does not look like a normal distribution (bell shaped curved).
It looks as though there are different subgroups in these animals.  
If we want to understand the weight values, we need to see what these subgroups are.

#The difference between rodent species

Your eye falls on the `species_id` column in the data frame.  This is a
two-letter code for the species of the animal.  What species do we have in this dataset?

Use the `table` function to display a table of the counts for each value of
`species_id` and assign the result to a variable called `species.table`

```{r}
#Use "table" to show the counts for each categorical value of "species_id"
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/IMV_species.count.R")
```

We might hypothesise that the different species will have different weight distributions.
To investigate, we can start by making a box plot with a box for every species.

Your box plot will have the different species on the x-axis, and the weights on the y-axis.

To do this, we want a box plot of `weight` *as a function of* `species_id`

```{r}
#Show a box plot of "weight" as a function of "species_id"
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

As we suspected, there is a big difference in species weights. If your plot is
right, you should see that the species `DS` is much heavier than the other
rodents, on average.  This is *Dipodomys spectabilis*: the banner-tailed kangaroo
rat that was excluded from some of the measurement plots.

#Narrowing the focus to a single species

It does not seem very useful for us to look at the weight for all rodents pooled
together, so we will restrict our attention to species `PB`. `PB` is Chaetodipus
Baileyi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey's_pocket_mouse).

To do this, use the `filter` command and a conditional to make a new data frame called `pb_only` that only includes
the `PB` rodents.

After you have made the new data frame, show the first six rows, to confirm you only have `PB` animals.

```{r}
#Use the filter command to make a new data frame called "pb_only" that
#contains only the animals with "species_id" of "PB".
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/IMV_pb.frame.R")
```

Now show the histogram of the weights from the new `pb_only` data frame.

```{r}
#- Plot a histogram of the "weight" column of "pb_only"
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

These weights should look a lot closer to a normal distribution (a bell shaped curve) than your
original histogram of weights from the rodents of all species combined.

Another factor that might affect weight is sex.

Display a table of the counts for the different values of `sex` in the `pb_only`
data frame and assign the result to a variable called `MF.table`.

```{r}
#- Display a table of the counts for each value of "sex" in "pb_only"
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/IMV_gender.count.R")
```

Show a box plot of the weights of the PB animals, as a function of sex:

```{r}
#Show a box plot of "weight" as a function of "sex" for the PB animals.
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

Your plot should show that female PB rodents weigh less on average than male PB rodents.

To take this effect into account, one simple thing we can do is to make a new data frame `pb_female` that only has the female PB rodents.

```{r}
#Make a new data frame called "pb_female" that contains only the female
#animals from the "pb_only" data frame.
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######


# Display the first six rows of the new "pb_female" data frame.
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/IMV_pb.female.frame.R")
```

#Looking at the plot effect
Next we consider whether the different type of plots in which the researchers measured the animals had an effect on
their weight.

First show a table of the counts for each value in the `plot_type` column of the
`pb_female` data frame and assign the result to a variable called `plot.table`.

```{r}
#Display a table of the counts for each value of "plot_type" in "pb_female"
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/IMV_plot.count.R")
```

Now make a box plot of `weight` as a function of `plot_type`, for the female PB rodents.

```{r}
#Show a box plot of "weight" as a function of "plot_type" for the female PB animals.
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

At first blush, there does not seem to be a convincing relationship between
nutrition, as measured by weight, and the plot types.

One explanation for this unconvincing boxplot result is that plot types do not
influence nutrition of PB rats.

Another possibility is that the `weight` value is not a very good indicator of
nutrition.  Maybe we need to take the size of the animals into account, when
looking at their weight.  Well nourished animals may be heavy for their size.

The `hindfoot_length` column is one index of animal size.  We could try taking
this into account.

Let's start by looking at the relationship between `hindfoot_length` and `weight`.

Make a scatter plot of `hindfoot_length` (on the x-axis) against `weight` (on the y-axis),
for the female PB rodents.

```{r}
#Show a plot of "hindfoot_length" on the x axis against "weight" on the y axis for the female PB rodents.
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

We are going to try using `hindfoot_length` in a similar way to the use of
height in the well-known calculation of body-mass index (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index).

Make a new variable called `rmi` for Rodent Mass Index.
It will be the rodent weight divided by the square of the rodent hindfoot length.

```{r}
#Create a new variable "rmi" that has the "weight" values from the "pb_female" data frame, divided by the squared "hindfoot_length" values.
#Hint: use mutate() to add this as an additional column to your `pb_female` dataframe
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

# Use "head" on this new data frame to show the first six values
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/IMV_check_rmi.R")
```

Show a histogram of the `rmi` values in the `pb_female` data frame:

```{r}
#Show a histogram of the values in `rmi`
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

Is this new `rmi` variable a better predictor of nutrition?  It's difficult to
know.  But we can ask whether it varies across the `plot_type`s more than the
raw `weight`.

Make a box plot of the `rmi` variable values as a function of the `plot_type`
values for the female PB rodents.

```{r}
#Show a box plot of "rmi" values as a function of "plot_type" for the female PB animals.
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

It seems that the relationship of `rmi` to `plot_type` still does not look completely
convincing.

#Looking deeper at the effectivess of the plot types

Thinking further, perhaps we have not got to the right data to answer our
question.  We are interested in the different plot types - but let us think
further about what we are interested in, exactly. For example, perhaps the key
thing for PB rat nutrition is the exclusion of the much larger DS rats.
Remember the DS rats are banner-tailed kangaroo rats, or "Krats" for short.

But - did the Krat exclosure plot types really exclude Krats effectively?

To investigate this, we can look at the cross-tabulation of `species_id` with
the `plot_type` in which each rat was measured. If the Krat exclosure plots
really excluded Krats, then we would expect there to be very few Krats measured
in the Krat exclosure types.  

For this question, we need to return to the full `rodent_dat` data frame.

```{r}
#Create a "plot_type" by "species_id" count table and store it as `ptype_by_species`
#HINT: to do this, you can give a comma-separated list of the two columns to table()
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/IMV_species.plot.count.R")
```

The table suggests that "Long-term Krat Exclosure"s do a reasonable but
imperfect job of excluding Krats.

#Restricting the analysis to 2 plot types

Given that we are interested in the nutrition of PB rats in the absence of
Krats, we can restrict our analysis of female PB rat weights to the "Control"
and "Long-term Krat Exclosure" plot types.

Make a new data frame called `pb_female_ctl_krat` that has the rows from
`pb_female` for which the `plot_type` is *either* "Control" *or* "Long-term Krat
Exclosure".

```{r}
#Make new data frame called "pb_female_ctl_krat" that has the rows from
#"pb_female" for which "plot_type" is "Control" or "Long-term Krat Exclosure".
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

# Show the first six rows.
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/IMV_pb.female.plot.frame.R")
```

To confirm that you have only have plot types "Control" and "Long-term Krat
Exclosure" in your new data frame, and to remind yourself of what the
differences in `rmi` values were, do a boxplot of the `rmi` values of the
`pb_female_ctl_krat` data frame, as a function of the plot type.

```{r}
#Show a box plot of "rmi" values as a function of "plot_type" for the female PB animals in "pb_female_ctl_krat".
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

Now this result looks potentially interesting, but do we have a "real" difference in the rmi between the two plot types?

To answer this, you could do a statistical test comparing the `rmi` values for the "Control" plot type to
the `rmi` values for the "Long-term Krat Exclosure" plot type.

You might want to come back to do this once you have learnt some more statistics on this course!

In the meantime, it could be useful to get the summary statistics for the rmi data by plot type and assign the result to a variable called `rmi_by_plot`.
```{r}
#summarise the mean of `rmi` for the two plot types (control and long term krat exposure)
#HINT 1: You can combine the use of summarise() and group_by()
#HINT 2: there are NAs in the rmi column, so you will need to specify na.rm=TRUE for the mean() function
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/IMV_rmi.plot.count.R")
```

This is the end of the notebook.
