This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. 
When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Your Task
Work through the code chunks in the following notebook to develop your understanding of how to create and manipulate variables and different types of data object in the R programming language. 

Follow the instructions for each code chunk, adding code where specified and using the exact variable names supplied. 
You can add your own additional code chunks as needed to gain further practice as you work through the notebook.

```{r}
#run this first cell to clear R's brain, always a good first step in any notebook you write
rm(list=ls())
```

First, run the following chunk to load the necessary libraries.

```{r}
library(assertthat)
library(stringr)
library(ottr)
```

#CREATING VARIABLES AND ASSIGNING VALUES 

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:
* Create an integer variable called `my_integer` and assign it a value of 7.
* Create a floating point (decimal) variable called `my_decimal` and assign it any number you choose.
* Create a string variable called `my_string` and assign it any value you like. 

```{r}
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE #######

```

Remember you can print out the value of your variables at any point by listing them.

```{r}
#run this chunk to see the values of your variables
my_integer
my_decimal
my_string
```


```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/basics_data_type.R")
```

#BASIC MANIPULATION OF VARIABLES

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:
* Create a variable called `var3` by multiplying `var1` by `var2`
* Create a variable called `var4` by dividing `var2` by `var1`

```{r}
var1 <- 10
var2 <- 5

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/basics_manip.R")
```

#CALLING EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS

As with Python, R and its associated packages have a range of functions that you can call upon when needed.

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:

* Set a variable `num1` to the absolute value of -78.2. To do this, use the function abs(...)
* Set a variable `len1` to the length of variable `str2`. To do this, use the function str_length(..) which is part of the stringr package.
* Convert `num1` from a number to a string variable and set the answer to a variable called `str3`. To do this, use the function toString()
* Convert `str3` back to a number and set the answer to a variable called `num2`. To do this, use the function as.numeric()

```{r}
str2 = "Hello everyone"

#COLLECTIONS OF OBJECTS IN R

Now let's practice using 4 important data types in R, including how to access the elements within them.

#The Vector: a one-dimensional set of items of the same type.

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:

* Create a vector called `vec1` containing the integers from 1 to 20. To do this, use c() and remember that x:y means the numbers from x to y
* Access the 5th element in the vector and assign it to a variable called `val5`. Remember that R is indexed from 1, so the 5th element is element number 5.
* Create a vector called `vec1_cropped` containing all the elements in `vec1` apart from the last element. To do this, remember to use negative indexing.
* Create a vector called `vec1_subset` containing elements 10 and 15 from `vec1`. To do this, remember to use c().
* Create a vector called `vec1_lower` containing elements from `vec1` whose value is less than 6. To do this, remember to use a conditional statement.

```{r}
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE ###

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/basics_vectors.R")
```

#The Matrix: a two-dimensional set of items of the same type.

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:

* Create a 3 x 3 matrix called `matrix3` containing the values 3, 6, 9 in row 1; 12, 15 and 18 in row 2; 21, 24 and 27 in row 3.
* Access the element in row 2, column 3 and assign it to a variable called `matnum1`.
* Access the third column of the matrix and assign it to a vector called `col3`. To do this, remember if you do not specify a range, R will give you all the rows (or all the columns).

```{r}
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE ###

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/basics_matrix.R")
```

#The List: a one-dimensional collection of objects that can be of different types.

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:

* Create a single list called `mylist` with 9 elements, each a single word (in order) from the phrase "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
* Extract the 5th element of the list in the form of another list called `onewordlist`.
* Extract the 7th element of the list in the form of the individual element (not a list) and call it `ele_seven`.
* Combine the even numbered elements of the list into a vector of strings called `even_vec`. To do this, use the combine function, c()

```{r}
################## ADD YOUR CODE UNDER THIS LINE ###

```

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/basics_list.R")
```

#The Data Frame: a Tables of items of different types, which can be given names and accessed by name

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:

* Create a data frame called `pop_contest` that has two columns called "language" and "popularity" and contains the following data structure:
language    popularity
Linux       25
Python      35
R           40
* Have a look at your data frame using the View() function. You will see your data frame graphically displayed in a new tab - nice!
* Extract the value in row 2, column 2 and assign it to a variable called `Pyscore`
* Create a vector called `scores` containing the popularity score for each language from column 2. To do this, you can refer to the column by number or by name.
* Extract a data frame called `highscores` containing only those rows where the score is equal to 35. To do this, you will need to use a conditional test.

```{r}
# Run this chunk to check your answers
. = ottr::check("tests/basics_dataframe.R")
```

#Finally, get some useful summary statistics about the data in your `pop_contest` data frame.

Add code to the chunk below that does the following:

* Use the summary() function on your `pop_contest` data frame.

You might like to try out knitting your document together as html now to see all the work you have done in the friendly html format.

Hopefully, this has given you some experience with the RStudio environment as well as objects, variables, data types and functions in the R language. 

You should now have everything you need to tackle the next lesson, where we will learn how to import and manipulate data in R.

This is the end of the notebook.
